.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImbusd\fR is MODBUS/TCP to MODBUS/RTU gateway.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-h\fR
Usage help.
.IP \fB-d\fR
Instruct \fImbusd\fR not to fork itself (non-daemonize).
.IP "\fB-L \fIlogfile\fR"
Specifies log file name ('-' for logging to STDOUT only, default is /var/log/mbusd.log).
.IP "\fB-v \fIlevel\fR"
Specifies log verbosity level. 0 enables logging of errors only,
1 also enables warnings and 2 enables information messages.
If \fImbusd\fR was compiled in debug mode, valid log levels are up to 9,
where log levels above 2 forces logging of information about additional
internal events.
.IP "\fB-c \fIcfgfile\fR"
Read configuration from cfgfile.
.IP "\fB-p \fIdevice\fR"
Specifies serial port device name.
.IP "\fB-s \fIspeed\fR"
Specifies serial port speed.
.IP "\fB-m \fImode\fR"
Specifies serial port mode (like 8N1).
.IP "\fB-P \fIport\fR"
Specifies TCP port number.
.IP \fB-t\fR
Enable RTS RS-485 data direction control (if not disabled while compile).
.IP "\fB-y \fIfile\fR"
Enable RS-485 direction data direction control by writing '1' to file
for transmitter enable and '0' to file for transmitter disable
.IP "\fB-Y \fIfile\fR"
Enable RS-485 direction data direction control by writing '0' to file
for transmitter enable and '1' to file for transmitter disable
.IP "\fB-C \fImaxconn\fR"
Specifies maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections.
.IP "\fB-N \fIretries\fR"
Specifies maximum number of request retries (0 - disable retries).
.IP "\fB-R \fIpause\fR"
Specifies pause between requests in milliseconds.
.IP "\fB-W \fIwait\fR"
Specifies response wait time in milliseconds.
.IP "\fB-T \fItimeout\fR"
Specifies connection timeout value in seconds (0 - disable timeout).
.SH NOTES
In case of situation when \fImbusd\fR received response with invalid CRC and can't correct
error by re-request, it return MODBUS/TCP packet with exception code 04. In case of situation
when \fImbusd\fR can't receive response from MODBUS RTU device (e.g. addressed controller
is not present on the network), it return MODBUS/TCP packet with exception code 0x0B.
.SH BUGS
Broadcast messaging on MODBUS network isn't supported.
